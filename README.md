# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
Assigned the project to analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 and create a compelling visualization for the Pyber CEO, V. Isualize.
• Deliverable 1: A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type
• Deliverable 2: A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type

## Resources
• City Data file:  "Resources/city_data.csv"
• Ride Data file: "Resources/ride_data.csv"



## Summary
The Analysis of the ride data shows
- Urban drivers made up over 69% of all drivers for the company
    o Rural – 5%
    o Suburban – 26%
- Urban fares made up over 81% of all income
    o Rural – 3%
    o Suburban – 16%
- Rural Drivers had highest Avg Fare per driver ($55.49) and Urban had the lowest ($16.57)

## Recommendations based on Summary
1- Increase the number of drivers in the Rural area as they had a better return based on Avg fare per driver
2- Reduce the number of drivers in the Urban market as they had too many drivers in comparison to the number of rides made
3- Suburban Drivers started showing a week over week increase in April. Increase number of drivers in this market going into the summer months
